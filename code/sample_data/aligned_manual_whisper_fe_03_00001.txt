Machine: Hello, my name is Tony Chiquia and I generally prefer eating at home. Hi, my name is Andy. Hello Andy. How are you? Good, how are you doing? Good. Do
Hand:    :                              and i generally prefer eating at home  hi  my name is andy  hello andy  how are you  good  how are you doing  good  do

Machine: you have any idea what's going on? No, I guess we're supposed to talk about food now. Yeah.    What's your preference? I like eating at a restaurant better. Okay.
Hand:    you have any idea what's going on  no  i guess we're supposed to talk about food now  yeah  um what's your preference  i like eating at a restaurant better  okay 

Machine:    Because I don't like to cook very much.       Did you say you preferred? I'm eating at home. You    didn't eat at home, why is that?    I don't
Hand:    um because i don't like to cook very much  which did you say you preferred  um  eating at home  eating            at home  why is that  um i don't

Machine: know,         I just enjoy eating at home better than, I mean, casual periodic dining out is fine, but generally speaking, I'm      eating at home. Yeah, I tend
Hand:    know  just uh i      enjoy eating at home better than  i mean  casual periodic dining out is fine  but generally speaking  i   like eating at home  yeah  i tend

Machine: to eat out probably        five or six weeks.        Wow. But I live in New York City, so. Oh, well that makes              it easier. It
Hand:    to eat out probably six or five or six nights a week wow  but i live in new york city  so  oh  well that makes a difference it         it

Machine: makes it easier. Yeah.                      We           live in Frederick, Maryland. Oh, okay. It's a lot.         Probably not as  many options. Yeah.       
Hand:    makes it easier  yeah  um where do you live we live uh i live in frederick  maryland  oh  okay  it's a lot  there's probably not too many options  smaller town

Machine:        What was our other question? I think that was it.                 That was it? If you preferred eating at home,      or at a restaurant?        
Hand:    yes um what was our other question  i think that was it  something about that was it  if you prefer    eating at home  yeah or at a restaurant  i think

Machine:        Yeah, I think that was the only question. Okay. So                       the first time you've got    one of these calls? Yeah,    it was 
Hand:    it was yeah  i think that was the only question  okay  so then what ha- is this the first time you've gotten one of these calls  yeah  is it your

Machine: so.        Yeah, likewise.      Yes. My friend is actually part,      one of     people running this study, I guess. Like     what? I have a friend who's,      
Hand:    first time yeah  like      wise yes  my friend is actually um    par- one of the people running this study  i guess  likewise       i have a friend who    is so

Machine: who turned me on   to this. He works for NIST, and he sent me an email about it. Yeah. I guess he's working on some of the programming behind this.
Hand:    who turned me onto    this  he works for       and he sent me an email about it  yeah  i guess he's working on some of the programming behind this 

Machine: Yeah.    I         actually work at the linguistic data consortium at Penn, which is    part of the group that's running, and I guess. Gotcha.     So what's
Hand:    yeah  my i used to actually work at the linguistic data consortium at penn  which is um part of the group that's running  it  i guess  got     you so       

Machine: the hard about it? Okay. So now what happened? I don't know. I think I thought that there would get a computer would come back. And um. Maybe if we
Hand:                       okay  so now what happens   i don't know  i think i thought      there would get a computer would come back  and um  maybe if we

Machine: stopped talking, they'll come back online. Well, there's      something about     minutes, though. Who   says     to talk for     minutes? I don't know. I think so. That's what's   
Hand:    stop    talking  they'll come back on      well  it      said something about ten minutes  though  we're supposed to talk for ten minutes  i don't know  i think so  that's what   it

Machine:      in the email.      I did retomping                      about     minutes. Right. So      I remember thinking, oh,     dollars or      minutes. Well, because they're taping
Hand:    said in the email  yeah i did read      i did read something about ten minutes  right  because i remember thinking  oh  ten dollars for ten minutes  well  because they're taping

Machine: us, so. Is it snowing up there? Yeah, it's snowing really badly, actually. Like     what? Where are you in New York?                 In Manhattan. In Manhattan.     My
Hand:    us  so  is it snowing up there  yeah  it's snowing really badly  actually  likewise       where are you in new york  like a blizzard in manhattan  in manhattan  mhm my

Machine: best friend lives on the Upper West Side at th     in          Columbus. That was    my friend lives on rd     in        Columbus.                           Right in the
Hand:    best friend lives on the upper west side at eighty seventh and columbus  oh   really my friend lives on eighty third and columbus  right in the neighborhood right in the

Machine: neighborhood. Yeah.          I think it's the Jackson Hole. Okay.           Jackson, a    little diner.                   Yeah, it's right on the first floor of
Hand:    neighborhood  yeah  uh is it i think it's the jackson hole  oh    yeah yeah jackson  hole        diner  it's right on the yeah  it's right on the first floor of

Machine: the building he's in. Oh, really? Have you been there? Mm-hmm. Yep. Anytime. What part of Maryland are you on?    Frederick, Maryland. We're an hour              north of
Hand:    the building he's in  oh  really  have you been there  mhm     many times    what part of maryland are you in  um frederick  maryland  we're an hour where's that north of

Machine: Washington, DC.  Oh, okay. And about an hour west of Baltimore. Oh, nice. So. And it's snowing here. We have about eight inches, eight to ten inches of snow. Oh,
Hand:    washington  d.c. oh  okay  and about an hour west of baltimore  oh  okay  so  and it's snowing here  we have about eight inches  eight to ten inches of snow  oh 

Machine: well, I'm no         actually. I haven't been outside all day, but I heard that it's... I mean, it's not since this morning, but I heard that there's supposed to
Hand:    wow   i   don't even actually  i haven't been outside all day  but i heard that         i mean       not since this morning  but i heard that there's supposed to

Machine: be,       I don't know, five days       or something like that. Yeah, it looks like we're in that neighborhood, too. Are you at work now?    No, actually, it
Hand:    be  eight i don't       five to   eight or something like that  yeah  it looks like we're in that neighborhood  too  are you at work now  um no  actually  i 

Machine: just came out to my parents house to shovel their driveway, and I'm headed back to my office. Oh, okay. And  I'm gonna put it around there for a while.
Hand:    just came out to my parents house to shovel their driveway  and i'm headed back to my office  oh  okay  putz                  around there for a while 

Machine: Yeah, more work. I figured my    school duties were called                    while.                 What do you do?    I'm an IT   consultant. IT   consultant? Yeah,
Hand:    yeah  i'm  work  i figured might as     well   do   these  little calls while while  i'm at work but what do you do  oh i'm an i.t. consultant  i.t. consultant  yeah 

Machine: I do computer programming stuff. Gotcha.     What do you do? I'm a real estate program. Oh. So it's a slow day in the real estate business, but       
Hand:    i do computer programming stuff  got     you what do you do  i'm a real estate broker   oh  so it's a slow day in the real estate business  but i have

Machine: a lot of plenty of paperwork      to do, so. How old are you?.. In     your shelf?.                                   Well, what are we three minutes into
Hand:    a lot of plenty of paper     work to do  so  how old are you    thirty four thirty  four and yourself twenty four mhm well  what are we three minutes into

Machine: this?    My phone actually records it. We're almost five minutes, actually.      Well, since the guy called me, the computer guy called me. Yeah, I   think they probably, that
Hand:    this  um my phone actually records it  we're almost five minutes  actually  okay well  since the guy called me  the computer guy called me  yeah  the            probably  that

Machine: was probably simultaneous when they did the... They'd           call everybody and then figure out              how to connect it. Everybody or something like that? So        do
Hand:    was probably simultaneous when they did the    uh     they just call everybody and then figure out introduction how to connect     everybody or something like that  so do you do

Machine: you have any idea      what is behind this program? What are they doing?              My guess is something with where you're from and different speech patterns or
Hand:    you have any idea what what is behind this program  what are they doing  what kind of my guess is something with where you're from and different speech patterns or

Machine: something like that. But what's the company that you heard about it through? What do they do?            Well,    my friend works for the government and he
Hand:    something like that  but what's the company that you heard about it through  what do they do  got you um well  my my friend works for the government     he

Machine: works at NIST.     And he's in the    automated speech recognition division. Oh, okay. I bet it's something with that then.         That would make sense. Because you're
Hand:    works at nist  mhm and he's in the uh automated speech recognition division  oh  okay  i bet it's something with that then  i think that would make sense  because see   

Machine: my friend works for the linguistic  data consortium and they do things like that. And you    actually turn   you on to this? What? That's how you found out about the
Hand:    my friend works for the linguistics data consortium and they do things like that  and that's who      turned you on to this  what  that's how you found out about the

Machine: library. Yeah, because      I used to work there. We did stuff with...            We'd read news articles and we'd try to  figure out what the main topic
Hand:    survey   yeah  because when i used to work there  we did stuff with    um got you we'd read news articles and we'd try and figure out what the main topic

Machine: and the news article was.    And the idea was that they were trying to figure out if software could be just as good as humans. So you   read an
Hand:    in  the news article was  um and the idea was      they were trying to figure out if software could be just as good as humans  so you'd read an

Machine: article and say, like, is it on the topic of, you know, the war and I    rack or something like that? Gotcha.                      So what's your
Hand:    article and say  like  is it on the topic of  you know  the war on  iraq      or something like that  got     you and got you some so what's your

Machine: favorite restaurant in New York? My         favorite restaurant. There's a place called...    What's your favorite type of food? Well, my favorite... sI like a lot of the       one kinds

Machine: of food. There's this restaurant called Rois, New York and I    actually have a few of them around the country, I think.    Which is sort of like Pan, Asian,
Hand:    of food  there's this restaurant called roy's new york and they actually have a few of them around the country  i think  um which is sort of like            

Machine: Hawaiian kind of food, I guess. Okay. Really, really good. My parents love it and they've been there a few times and once they had a bad experience and complained
Hand:                                    okay                                                                             and once i    had a bad experience and complained

Machine: about it and then they got a              coupon the next time. So then they started just finding things they're complaining about. That's      a good deal.      
Hand:    about it and then i    got a fifty dollar coupon the next time  so then they started to   finding things to      complain    about  it's   like a      deal  um no

Machine:     And actually, I just finished the project at work and they said we could do something to celebrate, I guess. So my coworker and I went there and spent
Hand:    way and actually  i just finished a   project at work and they said we could do something to celebrate  i guess  so my coworker and i went there and spent

Machine: like, I don't know, close to on                      a meal, which        was a very good meal. Wow. Because I would not be able to afford that
Hand:    like  i don't know  close to two hundred dollars and a meal  it    was it was a very good meal  wow  because i would not be able to afford that

Machine: on my own.    Did you go     to      school in New York? No, I went to    University of Pennsylvania and Philly. Gotcha.              Where'd you go
Hand:    on my own  um did you school did you school in new york  no  i went to um university of pennsylvania in  philly  as      well got you where'd you go

Machine: to school? I went to Mount St.   Mary's College. Oh, yeah. In Namadsburg, Maryland? Yeah, I   could go       into that. Yeah.   I mean, I've lived here all my life.
Hand:    to school  i went to mount saint mary's college  oh  yeah  in amittsburgh maryland  mhm   you like  maryland a    lot   yeah  i i mean  i've lived here all my life 

Machine:        So      it's a nice state.           New York's      fun place to come visit. My friend           lives up there and go up and
Hand:    and uh so it's it's a nice state  it's it's new york   is a fun place to come visit  my friend lives who lives up there     go up and

Machine: see him every once in a while, but I could never live there. He's transplanted and sworn   by it     and says he'll never move. And    so          
Hand:    see him every once in a while  but i could never live there  he's transplanted and swarmed by it and and says he'll never move  and uh so it's it's

Machine: it's nice to go visit and    spend a           long weekend or just     a show, but then I got to come home. Yeah, I used to think
Hand:    it's nice to go visit and to spend uh you know long weekend or to   see a show  but then i got to come home  yeah  i used to think

Machine: I could never live here, but then I don't know, once I moved here.      Yeah, that's what must have been    happening. Not different. It's not that bad once you
Hand:    i can   never live here  but then i don't know  once i moved here  it's yeah  that's what most that happens it's       not different  it's not that bad once you

Machine: move here. I feel like when you visit, you go to all the really crowded areas and do touristy things. When you live here, you don't          see that
Hand:    move here  i feel like when you visit  you go to all the really crowded areas and do touristy things  when you live here  you don't well mhm see that

Machine: as much. Right. That's a great city. I love it. I grew up in New Jersey, so I         come here a lot when I was a little kid.
Hand:    as much  right  it's   a great city  i love it  i grew up in new jersey  so i used to come here a lot when i was a little kid 

Machine: What part of Jersey?    Northern Jersey. Burden County. Just about everybody from out   of    the    sea, Marys was from Jersey. Oh, really? Yeah, I think Jersey's staple crop as
Hand:    what part of jersey  um northern jersey  burgen county  just about everybody from mount saint mary's is             from jersey  oh  really  yeah  i think jersey's staple crop is

Machine: college students.          It's like what the state produces most of    college students. That's what  we're doing.    Everybody from just about everybody from them out   was from New
Hand:    college students  isn't it it's like what the state produces most of is college students  that's funny no    seriously everybody from just about everybody from the  mount was from new

Machine: Jersey. Actually, everybody at Penn probably was from New Jersey too. Same.     That's a      small state.                    See, it's a smart state. We all go to college.
Hand:    jersey  actually  everybody at penn probably was from new jersey too  oh    see that's that's small state  that's what jersey see  it's a smart state  we all go to college 

Machine: Are there no colleges?    Aren't there like, like,   recorders? Records            in New Jersey.          Yeah, and the college in New Jersey. But that's about it. That's
Hand:    are there no colleges  in aren't there like  there's rutgers    rutgers rutgers is in     jersey  isn't it yeah  and the college of new jersey  but that's about it  that's

Machine: it. I think for the most part, people in New Jersey identify with either New York City or Philadelphia. Yeah. So people tend to go to other states and     all  
Hand:    it  i think for the most part  people in new jersey identify with either new york city or philadelphia  yeah  so people tend to go to other states because there

Machine: like  this. There's not that much in New Jersey itself.        So do you know my friend Steve Lewis? No. No. What does he do?           How about Shelley?
Hand:    isn't that  much    to  do        in new jersey itself  uh-huh so do you know my friend steve louis  no  no  what does he do  how about how about shelley 

Machine: She'll be.   Lannum.                     No.                           They both work for this company called Fitzmars and      Company. And            they actually just
Hand:    no     sorry shelby  lanam mm no neither no  they were they're both uh they both work for this company called fitz     morrison company  and um they um they actually just

Machine: got engaged. Shelby's from LA.      She lives in New York.    I'm not sure where her place is.     Steve's the one who lives at th     in          Columbus.
Hand:    got engaged  shelby's from l.a. and she lives in new york  oh i'm not sure where her place is  and steve's the one who lives at eighty seventh and columbus
