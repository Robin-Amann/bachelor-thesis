Machine:                                  Hello, my name is   Tony Chiquia and   I    generally prefer eating at   home. Hi, my  name  is   Andy. Hello Andy. How are  you?   Good,
Hand:    and i generally prefer eating at home   hi my   name is   andy    hello andy how       are    you    good how   are you doing good do    you   have  any idea what's going

Machine: how are you doing? Good. Do       you have any   idea what's going on? No,    I    guess      we're supposed        to talk about      food   now. Yeah. What's  your preference? I    like
Hand:    on  no  i   guess  we're supposed to  talk about food now    yeah  um  what's your preference i     like     eating at a    restaurant better okay um    because i    don't       like to  

Machine:      eating at   a     restaurant better. Okay. Because I            don't  like to   cook   very much. Did you say  you preferred? I'm eating at    home. You  didn't   eat   at    
Hand:    cook very   much which did        you     say   you     preferred um eating at   home eating at   home  why is  that um                 i      don't know  just uh     i enjoy eating

Machine: home,             why  is that? I    don't  know,    I      just enjoy eating at  home      better   than, I    mean,  casual periodic dining out      is fine, but generally speaking, I'm
Hand:    at    home better than    i     mean casual periodic dining out  is    fine   but generally speaking i     like eating at     home     yeah   i   tend to eat   out probably  six       or 

Machine: eating at home. Yeah,         I   tend to eat         out  probably five or six  weeks. Wow.  But I          live in New   York             City, so. Oh,  
Hand:    five   or six   nights a week wow but  i  live in new york city     so   oh well that   makes a   difference it   it makes it   easier yeah um        where

Machine: well that makes it                   easier.                    It   makes it  easier. Yeah.    We  live in   Frederick,         Maryland. Oh, okay. It's a   lot.      
Hand:    do   you  live  we live uh i live in frederick maryland oh okay it's a     lot there's probably not too  many options    smaller town      yes um    what was our  other

Machine:            Probably not  as  many options.  Yeah. What was our other            question? I  think that was it. That was        it?       If you preferred eating           
Hand:    question i think    that was it   something about that was it  if    you prefer eating    at home  yeah or  at  a    restaurant i   think it was yeah      i      think that

Machine:         at   home,    or   at a    restaurant? Yeah, I  think that                              was the   only  question. Okay. So the  first time you've      got  one
Hand:    was the only question okay so then what        ha-   is this  the  first time you've gotten one of  these calls yeah      is    it your first time yeah   like wise yes

Machine: of        these calls?      Yeah, it  was so. Yeah,  likewise.      Yes.  My       friend   is actually part, one    of  people running this study, I      guess. Like        
Hand:    my friend is    actually um par-  one of  the people running   this study i  guess likewise i  have     a     friend who is             so   who    turned me     onto this he

Machine: what? I   have a  friend who's, who turned me    on to    this. He   works for   NIST, and     he sent me an  email       about  it.  Yeah. I  guess he's working on      
Hand:    works for and  he        sent   me  an     email    about it    yeah i     guess he's  working on some of the programming behind this yeah  my i     used to      actually

Machine: some    of                  the        programming behind this. Yeah. I  actually work at  the   linguistic         data consortium at    Penn, which is part of the group         that's running,
Hand:    work at the linguistic data consortium at          penn   which is    um part     of   the group that's     running it   i          guess got   you   so okay so now what  happens i              

Machine: and I guess. Gotcha. So    what's the hard  about it?     Okay. So    now what happened? I     don't know. I    think I  thought that there would get     a       computer would come
Hand:                         don't know   i   think i     thought there would get a    computer  would       come  back and   um maybe   if   we    stop  talking they'll come     back  on  

Machine: back. And um.  Maybe     if    we  stopped talking,       they'll  come      back online. Well,   there's something about minutes,       though. Who    says to talk for minutes? I     don't  
Hand:    well  it  said something about ten minutes though   we're supposed to   talk for  ten     minutes i       don't     know  i        think so      that's what it said in  the      email yeah  i

Machine:     know. I think      so.       That's what's                         in                the email. I       did retomping about   minutes.         Right.  So        I  remember thinking, oh,     dollars
Hand:    did read  i did   read something about  ten    minutes right because i remember thinking oh  ten    dollars for ten       minutes well     because they're taping us so is       it        snowing up     

Machine: or    minutes. Well, because they're taping us,      so.      Is    it  snowing up there? Yeah, it's snowing really badly,   actually. Like      what?                  Where are    you   in     New  
Hand:    there yeah     it's  snowing really  badly  actually likewise where are you     in new    york       like    a      blizzard in        manhattan in    manhattan mhm my best  friend lives on the upper

Machine: York? In   Manhattan. In     Manhattan. My  best     friend lives  on the          Upper West   Side  at  th       in    Columbus. That was                my                          friend lives on
Hand:    west  side at         eighty seventh    and columbus oh     really my friend lives on    eighty third and columbus right in        the  neighborhood right in the neighborhood yeah uh is     it    i 

Machine: rd    in                    Columbus. Right in   the     neighborhood. Yeah. I             think it's the Jackson                    Hole. Okay. Jackson, a        little diner. Yeah, it's  
Hand:    think it's the jackson hole oh        yeah  yeah jackson hole          diner it's right on the   yeah     it's    right on the first floor of    the      building he's   in     oh    really

Machine: right on  the  first floor of   the   building he's in. Oh,      really? Have you been there?    Mm-hmm.  Yep.  Anytime. What         part of    Maryland are        you          on? Frederick,
Hand:    have  you been there mhm   many times what     part of  maryland are     you  in  um   frederick maryland we're an       hour where's that north of       washington d.c. oh okay and about     

Machine: Maryland. We're an   hour north     of Washington, DC. Oh, okay. And     about an hour west  of    Baltimore. Oh,   nice. So. And    it's snowing here. We  have about eight inches,  eight
Hand:    an        hour  west of   baltimore oh okay        so  and it's  snowing here  we have about eight inches     eight to    ten inches of   snow    oh    wow i    don't even  actually i    

Machine: to      ten  inches      of  snow. Oh, well, I'm  no actually. I   haven't been outside all day, but I heard that it's... I        mean, it's not   since this  morning, but
Hand:    haven't been outside all day but   i   heard that i  mean      not since   this morning     but  i     heard that there's supposed to    be   eight i     don't five     to 

Machine: I        heard     that there's supposed to      be,   I    don't know, five days         or  something like that. Yeah, it  looks like we're    in that neighborhood,     too. Are you    
Hand:    eight or something like         that     yeah it looks like we're in    that neighborhood too are       you  at    work  now um    no   actually i  just came          out to   my  parents

Machine: at    work now?   No,   actually, it  just came   out  to my parents house to   shovel their  driveway, and I'm headed back to my office. Oh, okay. And  I'm gonna   put  
Hand:    house to   shovel their driveway  and i'm  headed back to my office  oh    okay putz   around there     for a   while  yeah                   i'm   work i   figured might

Machine: it around there for   a      while. Yeah, more  work. I                figured               my school duties     were            called while. What do       you         do?   I'm
Hand:    as well   do    these little calls  while while i'm   at work but what do      you do oh i'm an i.t.   consultant i.t. consultant yeah   i      do   computer programming stuff got

Machine: an  IT   consultant. IT  consultant? Yeah,   I    do     computer programming stuff. Gotcha. What do   you do? I'm a    real   estate   program. Oh. So   it's a   slow day            
Hand:    you what do          you do          i'm   a real estate broker   oh          so     it's    a    slow day in  the real estate business but      i   have a    lot of   plenty of paper

Machine: in   the real estate business, but     a   lot    of   plenty of   paperwork to       do,    so.  How                                old  are  you?.. In your  shelf?.  Well,  
Hand:    work to  do   so     how       old are you thirty four thirty four and       yourself twenty four mhm well what are we three minutes into this um     my phone actually records

Machine: what       are    we   three   minutes  into this? My    phone actually records    it. We're    almost five   minutes, actually. Well, since    the  guy called   me,          the  computer guy called me.
Hand:    it   we're almost five minutes actually okay well  since the   guy      called  me the computer guy    called me       yeah      the   probably that was probably simultaneous when              they   did

Machine: Yeah, I  think they probably, that      was probably            simultaneous when they did     the...    They'd           call everybody and then figure out how to  connect it.           Everybody
Hand:    the   uh they  just call      everybody and then     figure out introduction how  to   connect everybody or     something like that      so       do     you do  you have    any idea what what     

Machine: or something like that?        So  do   you   have any  idea what is    behind                      this   program? What are       they   doing?   My guess     is   something with where  you're
Hand:    is behind    this program what are they doing what kind of   my   guess is     something with where you're from     and  different speech patterns or something like that      but  what's the   

Machine: from    and  different speech patterns or something like that. But  what's the company that you  heard about                  it             through? What  do they do? Well, my friend
Hand:    company that you       heard  about    it through   what do    they do     got you     um   well my    my    friend works for the government he       works at nist mhm and      he's  

Machine: works for the           government and         he       works      at NIST. And  he's      in   the  automated speech recognition division. Oh,   okay. I                 bet it's   something with that then.      
Hand:    in    the uh  automated speech     recognition division oh    okay i  bet   it's something with that then      i      think       that      would make  sense because see my  friend works     for  the  linguistics

Machine: That would      make sense. Because you're my   friend works for    the linguistic data consortium and they do   things like that. And   you actually turn you    on   to      this? What? That's
Hand:    data consortium and  they   do      things like that   and   that's who turned     you  on         to  this what that's how  you   found out about    the  survey yeah because when  i     used  

Machine: how you  found    out about the  library. Yeah, because I    used to                     work there. We     did stuff with... We'd read  news articles and  we'd    try to
Hand:    to  work there we did stuff with um       got   you     we'd read news articles and we'd try  and    figure out what  the     main topic in   the      news article was um

Machine: figure out what the main      topic  and the    news article was. And      the   idea was  that they were trying to figure out  if software could be  just as good
Hand:    and    the idea was they were trying to  figure out          if   software could be   just as   good as   humans so you'd  read an article  and   say like is it  

Machine: as humans. So    you read an   article and say, like, is it        on   the  topic of, you know, the war and  I                                     rack or   something 
Hand:    on the     topic of  you  know the     war on   iraq  or something like that got   you     and   got you some so what's your favorite restaurant in new  york restaurant

Machine: like that?   Gotcha. So    what's your favorite restaurant in   New      York? My      favorite restaurant. There's  a place called... What's your favorite  type  of food? Well,   my   favorite... sI like  
Hand:    um   there's a       place called r-   what's              your favorite type  of food well     my          favorite i like  a         lot    of   different kinds of food  there's this restaurant     called

Machine: a     lot of   the one  kinds    of   food. There's this restaurant called Rois, New     York and   I  actually have a    few of        them around the country, I think. Which
Hand:    roy's new york and they actually have a     few     of   them       around the   country i    think um which    is   sort of  like okay and  once   i   had      a             

Machine: is sort of like Pan, Asian, Hawaiian kind of food, I guess. Okay. Really, really good. My parents love it and they've    been there      a     few times and  once they
Hand:                                bad                                                                               experience and  complained about it  and   then i    got 

Machine: had a     bad    experience and complained about         it   and     then they    got    a  coupon   the   next time. So then they started just     finding  things they're              
Hand:    a   fifty dollar coupon     the next       time  so then they started to   finding things to complain about it's like  a  deal um   no      way  and actually        i       just finished

Machine:   complaining about. That's a   good deal. And actually, I  just      finished the       project at    work and they     said we could do    something to    celebrate, I guess. So   my    coworker
Hand:    a project     at     work   and they said  we  could     do something to       celebrate i       guess so   my  coworker and  i  went  there and       spent like       i don't  know close to      

Machine: and I       went    there and spent like,            I don't know,          close   to on    a   meal, which was a      very good meal. Wow. Because I   would
Hand:    two hundred dollars and   a   meal  it    was it was a very  good  meal wow because i  would not be    able  to  afford that on   my    own  um      did you  

Machine: not    be  able        to afford that on   my   own. Did you        go to           school in        New  York? No, I       went to             University of Pennsylvania
Hand:    school did you  school in new    york no i went to   um  university of pennsylvania in     philly as well got   you where'd you  go to school i went       to mount       

Machine: and   Philly. Gotcha. Where'd you  go to          school?  I   went to   Mount    St. Mary's College. Oh, yeah. In   Namadsburg, Maryland? Yeah,     I  could go  into that. Yeah. I    mean,
Hand:    saint mary's  college oh      yeah in amittsburgh maryland mhm you  like maryland a   lot    yeah     i   i     mean i've        lived     here  all my life  and uh   so    it's  it's a    

Machine:            I've      lived here all my           life. So            it's   a     nice state. New York's fun        place to  come  visit. My   friend lives
Hand:    nice state it's it's new   york is  a  fun place to    come visit my friend lives who  lives  up  there  go  up and see   him every        once in     a    

Machine: up    there and go    up    and  see   him  every        once in      a  while, but I   could never live  there.     He's transplanted and  sworn by   it      and          
Hand:    while but   i   could never live there he's transplanted and  swarmed by it     and and says  he'll never move   and uh   so           it's it's  it's nice to go  visit and

Machine: says he'll never move. And  so           it's nice       to   go  visit and     spend a    long weekend or just a  show, but then I     got  to   come
Hand:    to   spend uh    you   know long weekend or   to   see a show but then  i   got to    come home yeah    i  used to think i   can  never live here but 

Machine: home. Yeah, I     used to   think I     could never live here,  but  then I            don't know, once      I    moved here. Yeah, that's what must have been happening. Not  different.
Hand:    then  i     don't know once i     moved here  it's  yeah that's what most that happens it's  not   different it's not   that  bad   once   you  move here i    feel       like when      

Machine: It's not   that bad once you move here.  I       feel  like when you      visit, you  go  to   all  the really crowded areas and do   touristy things.            When you  
Hand:    you  visit you  go  to   all the  really crowded areas and  do   touristy things when you live here you don't  well    mhm   see that as       much    right it's a    great

Machine: live here, you  don't see that as much. Right. That's a  great city. I  love it.  I grew        up  in New    Jersey, so   I    come here   a  lot     
Hand:    city i     love it    i   grew up in    new    jersey so i     used  to come here a lot  when i was a  little kid     what part of   jersey um northern

Machine: when   I      was    a          little    kid. What  part  of     Jersey? Northern Jersey. Burden County. Just about everybody from out   of       the    sea, Marys was     from     Jersey. Oh, really? Yeah,
Hand:    jersey burgen county just about everybody from mount saint mary's is      from     jersey  oh     really  yeah i                    think jersey's staple crop is    college students isn't   it  it's    like 

Machine: I    think                Jersey's staple crop as      college  students. It's  like           what      the  state produces most      of   college students. That's what we're doing. Everybody from      just about everybody
