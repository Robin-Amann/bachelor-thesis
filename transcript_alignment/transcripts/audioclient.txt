asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.31-1068.90: Well,
asr:0: OUTPUT 1068.90-1070.43:  uh, they Latin Americans are noted for being
asr:0: OUTPUT 1070.43-1072.41:  slow about things like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1072.89-1074.18: Well, 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1074.18-1075.65: they made it, they made it real clear at the
asr:0: OUTPUT 1075.65-1077.18:  embassy, says
asr:0: OUTPUT 1077.18-1078.65:  uh, says you don't
asr:0: OUTPUT 1078.65-1080.18:  understand we're not like American
asr:0: OUTPUT 1080.18-1081.71: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1081.71-1083.42:  business, uh um we uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1083.42-1084.77: We process things
asr:0: OUTPUT 1084.77-1086.30:  at our own
asr:0: OUTPUT 1086.30-1088.04:  speed <laugh>. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1088.04-1089.36: So uh
asr:0: OUTPUT 1089.36-1091.97: , what these were uh,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1092.36-1093.89: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1093.89-1095.36: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1095.36-1098.39: Insects aside dispersing machines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.39-1099.95: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1099.95-1101.48: Uh, this guy
asr:0: OUTPUT 1101.48-1103.94: 's come up with an interesting concept. He's, he's basically, uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1103.94-1105.56: UM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1105.56-1107.96: What he's doing is he uh? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.13-1111.44: Has has made them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1111.47-1113.27: Super simple. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1113.81-1115.07: Uh
asr:0: OUTPUT 1115.07-1117.95:  everybody else is going with the real complex stuff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1117.95-1119.00: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1119.00-1120.95: And all kinds of uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1121.01-1122.75: All 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1122.75-1124.34: kinds of uh uh you know real fancy
asr:0: OUTPUT 1124.34-1125.87:  gadgets, and what he did was basically take
asr:0: OUTPUT 1125.87-1127.34:  a
asr:0: OUTPUT 1127.34-1128.93:  gasoline engine, a a uh Briggs and
asr:0: OUTPUT 1128.93-1130.46:  Stratton engine that you can pick up anywhere.
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.46-1131.93:  In fact, they're, they're
asr:0: OUTPUT 1131.93-1133.55:  cheaper there than they are here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1133.61-1135.29: Uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1135.29-1136.82: And uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1137.12-1138.89: Put a
asr:0: OUTPUT 1138.89-1140.48:  UH smog device on it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1140.78-1141.95: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1141.95-1143.60: So that 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1143.60-1145.49: it's powering this smog device, which is a blower yeah. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1145.49-1147.29: The
asr:0: OUTPUT 1147.29-1148.31:  crazy thing about it is to meet
asr:0: OUTPUT 1148.31-1150.20:  all the pollution standards. What you've had
asr:0: OUTPUT 1150.20-1152.00:  to do is come up with a very efficient
asr:0: OUTPUT 1152.00-1153.65:  blower to force
asr:0: OUTPUT 1153.65-1155.36:  extra air into the exhaust. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1155.99-1157.49: And
asr:0: OUTPUT 1157.49-1158.96:  I don't know if that really um uh changes
asr:0: OUTPUT 1158.96-1160.49:  the composition of the
asr:0: OUTPUT 1160.49-1162.77:  exhaust or just changes the percentage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1162.89-1164.30: Probably some of
asr:0: OUTPUT 1164.30-1165.83: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1165.83-1167.30:  both well it was about like when Uh
asr:0: OUTPUT 1167.30-1168.77:  Montana had to get rid
asr:0: OUTPUT 1168.77-1170.36:  of the
asr:0: OUTPUT 1170.36-1171.89:  <human> that they Uh
asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.89-1174.68:  just Uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1176.00-1177.20: Heated
asr:0: OUTPUT 1177.20-1178.73: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.73-1180.26:  them to super hot, and then
asr:0: OUTPUT 1180.26-1181.85:  it became
asr:0: OUTPUT 1181.85-1183.38:  colorless, and they let it
asr:0: OUTPUT 1183.38-1184.85:  out
asr:0: OUTPUT 1184.85-1186.38:  the stack <laugh>. But
asr:0: OUTPUT 1186.38-1188.00:  they don't see, won't hurt us, uh-huh,
asr:0: OUTPUT 1188.00-1189.53:  and then then
asr:0: OUTPUT 1189.53-1192.32:  they took all sorts of pictures, took them to <human>. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1193.31-1195.50: But uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1197.24-1199.07: A uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1201.92-1203.30: I don't
asr:0: OUTPUT 1203.30-1204.89: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1204.89-1206.42:  don't, I'm uh, have we been talking thirty minutes?
asr:0: OUTPUT 1206.42-1207.95:  Yeah, I don't think
asr:0: OUTPUT 1207.95-1209.42:  so okay,
asr:0: OUTPUT 1209.42-1212.42:  uh, well, let's talk about Christmas a minute. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1212.42-1213.95: All

asr:0: OUTPUT 1215.42-1218.18:  back problems, we really hadn't made plans, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1218.18-1219.29: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1219.29-1220.82: Uh, we'll, we'll kind of see how things go
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.82-1223.64:  here. It may be the other side of Christmas before we come see you.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.38-1299.18:  something sweeter, you
asr:0: OUTPUT 1299.18-1300.83:  know, and it shrinks when
asr:0: OUTPUT 1300.83-1303.53:  I'm not eating anything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1304.10-1305.42: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1305.42-1306.95: It
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.95-1308.96:  It Gets When I'm Eating Stuff the Sweet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1311.03-1312.26: Uh, it's about
asr:0: OUTPUT 1312.26-1314.21:  uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1316.22-1317.54: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1317.54-1319.07: Uh, it's about the size of
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.07-1320.66:  a a
asr:0: OUTPUT 1320.66-1323.03:  uh, what makes that noise? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1323.03-1324.53: I don't know

asr:0: OUTPUT 1326.06-1327.80:  uh, it's uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1327.80-1329.06: It's
asr:0: OUTPUT 1329.06-1330.53: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.53-1333.41:  about the size of a a ping pong ball, but oh my. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1333.68-1335.12: When
asr:0: OUTPUT 1335.12-1336.65:  it, when it, it's down,
asr:0: OUTPUT 1336.65-1338.84:  it's, it's, uh, it's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1338.84-1340.46: That size of marble
asr:0: OUTPUT 1340.46-1342.29:  maybe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.29-1343.61: Oh! 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1344.03-1345.05: You
asr:0: OUTPUT 1345.05-1346.58:  know, she had
asr:0: OUTPUT 1346.58-1348.41:  to take one else on the other side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1348.41-1349.58: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1349.58-1351.05: And
asr:0: OUTPUT 1351.05-1352.64:  uh, what kind of got me concerned about
asr:0: OUTPUT 1352.64-1354.29:  it was that uh,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1354.29-1355.97: She uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1357.53-1359.36: Oh! 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1359.45-1361.01: Did a
asr:0: OUTPUT 1361.01-1362.48:  needle biopsy on it
asr:0: OUTPUT 1362.48-1364.01:  first <laugh>
asr:0: OUTPUT 1364.01-1365.60:  and the bopsy came back
asr:0: OUTPUT 1365.60-1367.67:  malignant? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1367.73-1369.35: Uh, at least they had
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.35-1370.94:  found some
asr:0: OUTPUT 1370.94-1372.56:  malignant cells in it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1372.92-1374.03: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1374.03-1375.56: And then when she took it
asr:0: OUTPUT 1375.56-1377.03:  out and had a
asr:0: OUTPUT 1377.03-1379.97:  bobsy run on it, they couldn't find any molecular sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1380.39-1381.56: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1381.56-1383.09: But now this one's
asr:0: OUTPUT 1383.09-1384.56:  spoiling up <laugh>
asr:0: OUTPUT 1384.56-1386.15: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1386.15-1387.74:  uh, it makes you think about
asr:0: OUTPUT 1387.74-1389.27:  things like that anyway.
asr:0: OUTPUT 1389.27-1390.80: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1390.80-1392.27:  Well yeah, I think I would
asr:0: OUTPUT 1392.27-1394.16:  too, but uh,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1394.28-1395.93: Well uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1398.27-1400.46: Just uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.64-1401.99: Take it as it comes
asr:0: OUTPUT 1401.99-1403.52: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1403.52-1405.11:  well,
asr:0: OUTPUT 1405.11-1407.06:  not like you got a lot of options huh yeah. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1407.15-1409.19: Uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1410.36-1411.98: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1411.98-1413.87: No, I, I really don't have a lot of options. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1414.35-1416.36: Uh but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1416.36-1419.27: That's uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1421.04-1422.69: It's
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.69-1424.88:  It's Probably Going to Have to Come Out Anyway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1425.09-1427.85: Whether It's malignant or not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1427.94-1429.50: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1429.50-1431.03: Looks like eventually you'd run out, 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1431.03-1433.16: but I guess there so many in there anyway that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.19-1434.93: You don't really. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1435.08-1436.67: Notice it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1436.73-1437.96: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.96-1440.51: I ask her the same question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1440.51-1441.86: I says
asr:0: OUTPUT 1441.86-1443.39:  am
asr:0: OUTPUT 1443.39-1444.86:  I going to run out of saliva glands. She
asr:0: OUTPUT 1444.86-1446.39:  says oh no,
asr:0: OUTPUT 1446.39-1449.21:  it says you got so many you never run out of them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1449.69-1451.82: But uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1452.18-1453.92: I think uh
asr:0: OUTPUT 1453.92-1456.53:  since she removed that one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1456.53-1459.17: That i do have more dry mouth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1459.71-1460.85: I did before
asr:0: OUTPUT 1460.85-1462.38:  yeah
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.38-1463.91: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1463.91-1465.80:  uh, i don't know whether it's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1465.80-1466.91: 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1466.91-1468.38: The
asr:0: OUTPUT 1468.38-1470.06:  Uh, the Mild Imagination, or What But Uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1470.42-1472.55: It uh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1473.57-1475.73: That way.
