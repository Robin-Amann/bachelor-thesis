1. Estimate the frame-wise label probability from audio waveform
2. Generate the trellis matrix which represents the probability of labels aligned at time step.
   - trellis : (Transcript x Time) Matrix
3. Find the most likely path from the trellis matrix.
   - backtacking
   - merge labels
   - merge words
