You don't want to be recorded?
Well, I don't care.
Well, I tell this is for the University of
Pennsylvania.

Well, I mean, we've got 30 minutes to talk.
We've got 30 minutes to talk. Oh, OK.
We've got to talk 30 minutes.
All right. Well,

I know I'm at the end of that time.
I'm at the end of that time.
I'll say I know I'm traveling with a pro here.
OK. Now
I don't know what to do here.
I guess we just talk.

Let's say

I got to read the instructions.

How soon we just talk?
Yes, sir.

So how you doing?
Oh, pretty good. How are you making it?
Oh, OK.


I was acting up a little bit there for a while, but we seemed to
straighten that out.
Now what?
I think my back was acting up for a little bit there, but
it

seemed to straighten that out. Or at least we're heading
that direction.
You know, I still have a little tinge
under my, I call it my floating ribs.

From that seat where that seat belt went in.

But I guess it'll heal eventually.
It's
just one of those things
that can't do anything bad. It don't show up on the X-ray. So
this is too bad.

Well, all the X-rays going to show you is the
bone.

I mean, it won't show you any of the soft
damage.
No, I've got to go into the doctor
on Wednesday.
