1. Estimate the frame-wise label probability from audio waveform
2. Generate the trellis matrix which represents the probability of labels aligned at time step.
   - trellis : (Transcript x Time) Matrix
3. Find the most likely path from the trellis matrix.
   - backtacking
   - merge labels
   - merge words


- CTC for long chunks of audio does not work very well
- keep sample rate of 16 kHz in mind
- second speaker speaks relly quite. this does confuse CTC because it does not pick it up as speech.
